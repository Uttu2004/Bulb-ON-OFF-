 Bulb ON/OFF App
 
This is a simple JavaScript project where you can turn a light bulb **ON or OFF** by clicking a button â€” just like a real switch! Perfect for beginners learning JavaScript basics like `onclick`, `if-else`, and `getElementById`.

 Features i have used are:

- Shows a bulb image on screen
- Button to toggle the bulb ON or OFF
- Changes bulb image based on the state
- Uses simple JavaScript logic (no frameworks)

  What I Learned:
  
- How to use `onclick` in HTML buttons
- How to select HTML elements using `getElementById`
- How to change image using JavaScript (`img.src`)
- How to use basic `if-else` conditions

ðŸ”§ Technologies that i have used are :

-  HTML â€“ for the page structure  
-  CSS â€“ for basic styling  
-  JavaScript â€“ for the bulb switching logic
